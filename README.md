# Hewitt Research Foundation PyQt5 Desktop Application

This repository contains the source code for the desktop application that I wrote for the Spokane nonprofit organization Hewitt Research Foundation.  The program is a Python PyQt5 library application.

NOTE: You can view this application by opening the repository in a text editor and running the script_manager.pyw file.  The application buttons will not work properly because they run Python scripts that require database connectivity, but you can push the buttons to see the error QMessage box that is generated in response to the error.

The following libraries were the Python libraries that I had to install as dependencies for this desktop application:

* pip install pypiwin32
* pip install pywin32
* pip install pywinpty
* pip install pyodbc
* pip install pyqt5
* pip install pyinstaller
